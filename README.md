# üê• NightlyShutdown üê•

*A PowerShell utility to auto-shutdown your PC if left unattended.*

For anyone who falls asleep (or steps away) with their PC still running‚Äîwhether you're binge-watching or just forget to shut down. It gently prompts you, then gracefully closes apps and powers off if there's no response.

## How it works

1. Displays a full-screen neon-style prompt (‚ÄúAre you still there?‚Äù) with a 2-minute timeout.  
2. If unanswered, shows toast notifications (via BurntToast) and, in order:
   - Minimizes all windows  
   - Mutes system audio  
   - Attempts to close all user-visible applications (twice for safety)  
   - Shuts down the computer  

Each step gives you time to intervene before the next action.
